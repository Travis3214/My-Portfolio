            <p>I learned to code by going to the University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>The course focused on Javascript and many of the framworks and libriaries that are widely used today.</p>
            <p>Throughout the course I worked individually on many front-end and back-end projects.</p>
            <p>I also got to work in groups on full-stack projects that we showed off to the class.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding im usually hanging out with family, lifting weights, or playing basketball to maintain a healthy work life balance.</p>
            <p>I'm a die hard Orlando Magic fan that loves going to games and supporting my home team!</p>
